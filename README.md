# SafeLink: Phishing URL Detection Model
This repository contains code for detecting phishing URLs using data science techniques and machine learning models. Phishing URLs are deceptive links that attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information.

## Overview
Phishing attacks continue to be a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike. Traditional methods of URL filtering may not be sufficient to catch all phishing URLs due to their dynamic and constantly evolving nature. In this project, we leverage data science and machine learning to build a robust phishing URL detection system.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
- XGBoost: An efficient and scalable gradient boosting library.
- LightGBM: A fast, distributed, and high-performance gradient boosting framework.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to analyze data and model performance.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- WordCloud: For generating word clouds to visualize text data.
- Getting Started
- To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Model Building
We experiment with various machine learning algorithms including XGBoost and LightGBM. These algorithms are known for their ability to handle large datasets efficiently and achieve high accuracy. We train the models using a combination of feature engineering techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our models using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves to gain insights into model behavior and identify areas for improvement.
